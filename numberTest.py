    Automates the Sequence Memory test:

    This test runs indefinitely, generating a pattern of length n on a 3x3 grid where
    n is the number of correct attempts. The user then has to repeat that pattern on the
    grid in the correct order. 

    The AI will have to add the full sequence to a list, then play that list back.
    Each time, the list will have to grow to fit the next move.
