## Human Benchmark AI

This project is for educational purposes. 

The goal of the project is to learn python keyboard and mouse libraries to better understand automation.
This project aims to automate scoring for the novelty website <https://humanbenchmark.com>

Each task in the human benchmark poses an interesting challenge from a programming perspective, and deals with image and text processing.

This readme will be updated as each of the 8 challenges are completed, the ultimate goal is to have a program capable of 
scoring in the 99th percentile for each of the challenges.

## The Challenges
# Reaction Time

The reaction time challenge tasks the user with clicking the screen as fast as possible when it turns from green to red.
This challenge, from a coding perspective, deals with processing screenshots and extracting pixel RGB values as fast as possible.

This was the first challenge I took, as it has the least steps, but has the interesting constraint of having to process data quickly.
